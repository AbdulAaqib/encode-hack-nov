ðŸ§¾ Step 3: Gather Blockchain Data

To detect fraudulent activities, you need to collect relevant blockchain transaction data. Here's how you can do it:

1. Set Up the Envio Hypersync Client

First, ensure you have the Envio Hypersync client installed and configured. This client allows you to query blockchain data efficiently.

pip install hypersync

2. Fetch Transaction Data

Use the client to fetch transaction data. For instance, to get ERC-20 token transfers:

from hypersync import Client

client = Client(api_key="your_api_key")
transactions = client.get_transactions(
    token_address="0xTokenAddress",
    from_block=1000000,
    to_block=2000000
)


This will return a list of transactions between the specified blocks.

3. Extract Relevant Fields

For fraud detection, focus on extracting the following fields:

From Address: The sender's wallet address.

To Address: The recipient's wallet address.

Value: The amount of cryptocurrency transferred.

Timestamp: The time when the transaction occurred.

Token Address: The contract address of the token involved (if applicable).

Store this data in a structured format like a Pandas DataFrame for easy analysis.

ðŸ§  Step 4: Implement Suspicious Activity Detection Logic

With your transaction data ready, you can now implement logic to identify suspicious activities.

1. Statistical Anomaly Detection (Z-Score Analysis)

The Z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. A high absolute Z-score indicates an outlier.

import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import zscore

# Assuming df is your DataFrame containing transaction data
df['z_score'] = zscore(df['value'])
suspicious_transactions = df[df['z_score'].abs() > 2]


Transactions with a Z-score greater than 2 or less than -2 are considered statistically unusual

2. Network Analysis (Graph-Based Detection)

Construct a graph to analyze the connectivity between addresses:

import networkx as nx

G = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, 'from', 'to', ['value'])
centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)
suspicious_addresses = [node for node, cent in centrality.items() if cent > 0.7]


Addresses with a high degree centrality might be central hubs in a fraudulent network

.

3. Rule-Based Heuristics

Implement simple rules to flag suspicious activities:

# Flag transactions involving large amounts
large_transactions = df[df['value'] > 1000]

# Flag transactions involving new addresses
new_addresses = df[df['timestamp'] > '2025-01-01']


These rules can help identify transactions that deviate from normal patterns.

ðŸ“Š Step 5: Visualize and Interpret Results

Visualization tools can help you interpret the flagged suspicious activities.

1. Transaction Value Distribution

Plot the distribution of transaction values to identify outliers:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.hist(df['value'], bins=50)
plt.title('Transaction Value Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

2. Network Graph

Visualize the network of transactions to spot unusual connections:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
nx.draw(G, node_size=50, with_labels=False, alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Transaction Network')
plt.show()

3. Interactive Dashboards

For real-time monitoring, consider using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Looker to create interactive dashboards that highlight suspicious activities
