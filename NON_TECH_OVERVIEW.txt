Sniffer in Plain Language
=========================

Imagine an investigation desk with three teammates:

1. Sniffer the canine detective (the chat window)
   - You tell Sniffer which wallets, contracts, pools, or transactions you are curious about.
   - Sniffer double-checks what you mean and asks the rest of the team for evidence before answering.
   - Sniffer then returns with a friendly briefing, highlights of anything odd, and suggestions on where to dig next.

2. The research analysts (the backend tools)
   - They pull blockchain records from HyperSync, a service that stores Ethereum history.
   - They look for warning signs: sudden price jumps, unusually large transfers, wallets talking to themselves, or two addresses trading back and forth too neatly.
   - For each red flag they file a short alert with a severity label (low, medium, high).

3. The data intern (the Streamlit dashboard)
   - Keeps the office organized, showing the Sniffer logo, live market stats, and the chat interface in a simple web page.
   - Converts the analysts’ findings into easy tables, charts, and summaries so you can read them at a glance.

How a typical request flows
---------------------------
1. You enter a question in the chat, such as “Check these wallet addresses” or “Explain this transaction hash.”
2. Sniffer decides which analyst should look into it (wallet review, event log sweep, swap surveillance, or single transaction check).
3. The chosen analyst gathers raw blockchain data from HyperSync and runs their fraud sniffing playbook.
4. The analyst sends back a report with alerts, metrics, and raw excerpts.
5. Sniffer rewrites the findings in plain language, adds any charts, and presents the report in the chat conversation.

Extra touches
-------------
- Sniffer asks for missing details (like block ranges) before running a search so the results stay focused.
- If the system spots something suspicious, it shows higher-severity alerts first, along with a suggested follow-up.
- Friendly dog images change with each stage—thinking, investigating, celebrating a finished report.

In short: you describe what you want to investigate, Sniffer coordinates with the data team, and you get a clean, story-style summary of any suspicious blockchain behavior.
